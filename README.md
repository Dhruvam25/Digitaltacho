# Digitaltacho
Optical digital tachometers is a non-contact device that can be used to assess RPMs by measuring the number of rotations a reflective surface makes in a minute. Wide speed range and the various measurement modes make this suitable for measuring speed in many applications. Nearly all types of transportation vehicles, from planes to trucks to buses to trains to cars have tachometers. This instrument is also vital in troubleshooting machinery performance and conducting preventive maintenance inspections. 

The 3 bit 7 segment common anode display shows the count of rev/sec by the rotating strip placed in front of the photo transistor. Which is conditioned by removing the unwanted noises in the pulse-train with the help of LM324 Op-amp IC.

The LCD display successfully shows an output of 1800 RPM on Proteus software after a time duration of 1 minute (Real time computation).
The LED display showed a varying speed since it measures the rotations in seconds.
